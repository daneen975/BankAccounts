Bank Accounts - Lab 4
COE318: Object-Oriented Programming

Overview
This Java application models a simple banking system using object-oriented principles. It simulates both individual bank accounts and a bank that manages multiple accounts. Users can create accounts, deposit or withdraw funds (with validation), and prevent duplicate account numbers. The project introduces arrays, loops, and conditional logic, and requires implementation from scratch.

Objectives
- Implement an Account class
- Implement a Bank class using arrays
- Enforce rules for deposits, withdrawals, and unique account numbers
- Use loops and conditionals to manage logic
- Practice writing a class from scratch (no starter code for Account)

Project Files
- Account.java: Models a single bank account with name, number, and balance
- Bank.java: Manages a collection of Account objects using an array
- MainAccount.java: Test class for the Account functionality
- MainBank.java: Test class for the Bank functionality
